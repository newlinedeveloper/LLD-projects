Low-level design of a BookMyShow system using Java would involve several components. Here is an example of one possible implementation:

Theater: A class that represents a theater. It would have properties such as the name of the theater, location, and the number of seats available in each row.

Movie: A class that represents a movie. It would have properties such as the name of the movie, release date, director, and a list of showtimes.

Show: A class that represents a show of a movie. It would have properties such as the movie, theater, start time, and remaining seats.

Booking: A class that represents a booking. It would have properties such as the show, number of seats, and the user who made the booking.

User: A class that represents a user. It would have properties such as the name, email, and a list of bookings.

BookMyShow: A class that represents the main system. It would have properties such as a list of theaters, movies, and users, and methods to create a new booking, cancel a booking, and retrieve a list of available shows for a given movie and location.

Seat: A class that represents a seat. It would have properties such as the row and column number of the seat and its availability.

Payment: A class that represents a payment. It would have properties such as the amount and the payment method.

Ticket: A class that represents a ticket. It would have properties such as the show, the seats, and the payment.

Validation: A class that validates the inputs of the system. It would have methods such as validateEmail, validateUserName, validateMovieName.

The classes would interact with each other to perform various actions such as creating a new booking, canceling a booking, and retrieving a list of available shows. The BookMyShow class would serve as the entry point for the system and would be responsible for coordinating the actions of the other classes.

It's worth mentioning that this is just one possible implementation and depending on the requirements of your system, the design may vary.


```
class User {
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private List<Booking> bookings;

    public User(String name, String email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
        bookings = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addBooking(Booking booking) {
        bookings.add(booking);
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }

    public List<Booking> getBookings() {
        return bookings;
    }
}

class BookMyShow {
    private List<Theater> theaters;
    private List<Movie> movies;
    private List<User> users;

    public BookMyShow() {
        theaters = new ArrayList<>();
        movies = new ArrayList<>();
        users = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addTheater(Theater theater) {
        theaters.add(theater);
    }

    public void addMovie(Movie movie) {
        movies.add(movie);
    }

    public void addUser(User user) {
        users.add(user);
    }

    public Booking createBooking(Show show, int numberOfSeats, User user) {
        Theater theater = show.getTheater();
        boolean seatsBooked = theater.bookSeats(row, column, numberOfSeats);
        if (!seatsBooked) {
            return null;
        }
        Booking booking = new Booking(show, numberOfSeats, user);
        user.addBooking(booking);
        return booking;
    }

     public boolean cancelBooking(Booking booking) {
        Show show = booking.getShow();
        Theater theater = show.getTheater();
        User user = booking.getUser();
        int numberOfSeats = booking.getNumberOfSeats();
        boolean seatsCancelled = theater.cancelBooking(row, column, numberOfSeats);
        if (!seatsCancelled) {
            return false;
        }
        user.getBookings().remove(booking);
        return true;
    }

    public List<Show> getAvailableShows(Movie movie, String location) {
        List<Show> availableShows = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Show show : movie.getShows()) {
            Theater theater = show.getTheater();
            if (theater.getLocation().equals(location)) {
                availableShows.add(show);
            }
        }
        return availableShows;
    }
   }


```

This is an example of how the BookMyShow system might be implemented in Java. The classes interact with each other to perform various actions such as creating a new booking, canceling a booking, and retrieving a list of available shows. The BookMyShow class serves as the entry point for the system and coordinates the actions of the other classes.


Here is an example of how the createBooking and cancelBooking methods of the BookMyShow class can be implemented using the synchronized keyword to ensure thread-safety:

```
class BookMyShow {
    // previous code ...
    private Object lock = new Object();
    
    public synchronized Booking createBooking(Show show, int numberOfSeats, User user) {
        Theater theater = show.getTheater();
        synchronized (lock) {
            boolean seatsBooked = theater.bookSeats(row, column, numberOfSeats);
            if (!seatsBooked) {
                return null;
            }
            Booking booking = new Booking(show, numberOfSeats, user);
            user.addBooking(booking);
            return booking;
        }
    }

    public synchronized boolean cancelBooking(Booking booking) {
        Show show = booking.getShow();
        Theater theater = show.getTheater();
        User user = booking.getUser();
        int numberOfSeats = booking.getNumberOfSeats();
        synchronized (lock) {
            boolean seatsCancelled = theater.cancelBooking(row, column, numberOfSeats);
            if (!seatsCancelled) {
                return false;
            }
            user.getBookings().remove(booking);
            return true;
        }
    }
}


```
Here is an example of how the createBooking and cancelBooking methods of the BookMyShow class can be implemented using ReentrantLock:

```
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

class BookMyShow {
    // previous code ...
    private ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public Booking createBooking(Show show, int numberOfSeats, User user) {
        Theater theater = show.getTheater();
        lock.lock();
        try {
            boolean seatsBooked = theater.bookSeats(row, column, numberOfSeats);
            if (!seatsBooked) {
                return null;
            }
            Booking booking = new Booking(show, numberOfSeats, user);
            user.addBooking(booking);
            return booking;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public boolean cancelBooking(Booking booking) {
        Show show = booking.getShow();
        Theater theater = show.getTheater();
        User user = booking.getUser();
        int numberOfSeats = booking.getNumberOfSeats();
        lock.lock();
        try {
            boolean seatsCancelled = theater.cancelBooking(row, column, numberOfSeats);
            if (!seatsCancelled) {
                return false;
            }
            user.getBookings().remove(booking);
            return true;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}


```

Please note that this is a simplified example and in a real-world scenario, you may need to handle other types of concurrency issues as well, such as deadlocks and starvation, and take into account how the system will behave under high loads, and how to scale



#### Testcases

Here is an example of test cases and sample inputs for the createBooking and cancelBooking methods of the BookMyShow class:

```
public class BookMyShowTest {
    private BookMyShow bookMyShow;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        bookMyShow = new BookMyShow();
        Theater theater = new Theater("Theater 1", "New York", 10, 20);
        Movie movie = new Movie("Movie 1", new Date(), "Director 1");
        Show show = new Show(movie, theater, new Date());
        movie.addShow(show);
        bookMyShow.addTheater(theater);
        bookMyShow.addMovie(movie);
    }

    @Test
    public void testCreateBooking() {
        User user = new User("User 1", "user1@example.com");
        bookMyShow.addUser(user);
        Booking booking = bookMyShow.createBooking(show, 2, user);
        assertNotNull(booking);
        assertEquals(show, booking.getShow());
        assertEquals(2, booking.getNumberOfSeats());
        assertEquals(user, booking.getUser());
    }

    @Test
    public void testCancelBooking() {
        User user = new User("User 1", "user1@example.com");
        bookMyShow.addUser(user);
        Booking booking = bookMyShow.createBooking(show, 2, user);
        assertTrue(bookMyShow.cancelBooking(booking));
        assertEquals(0, user.getBookings().size());
    }
}


```


In this example, the setUp method creates a new BookMyShow object, a new Theater, a new Movie, and a new Show. The testCreateBooking test case creates a new user, calls the createBooking method, and checks that the returned booking is not null, the show, number of seats, and user match the expected values.
The testCancelBooking test case creates a new user, calls the createBooking method, then calls the cancelBooking method and checks that the booking is cancelled and the user's bookings list is empty.

You can add more test cases to cover different scenarios and edge cases and also include test cases for other methods in the BookMyShow class.
