A chess game can be implemented in Java using the Object-Oriented Design principles. The main components of the chess game include the chess board, chess pieces, and the players. Here is an example of a possible low-level design for a chess game in Java:


```
interface ChessPiece {
    boolean move(int x, int y);
}

class Pawn implements ChessPiece {
    int x, y;

    public Pawn(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public boolean move(int x, int y) {
        // logic for pawn move
    }
}

class Knight implements ChessPiece {
    int x, y;

    public Knight(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public boolean move(int x, int y) {
        // logic for knight move
    }
}

// other chess pieces such as Rook, Bishop, Queen, and King

class ChessBoard {
    ChessPiece[][] board;

    public ChessBoard() {
        board = new ChessPiece[8][8];
        // initialize the board with chess pieces
    }

    public boolean move(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
        if (board[x1][y1] == null) {
            return false;
        }
        return board[x1][y1].move(x2, y2);
    }
}

class Player {
    String name;
    Color color;

    public Player(String name, Color color) {
        this.name = name;
        this.color = color;
    }
}

class ChessGame {
    ChessBoard board;
    Player player1, player2;

    public ChessGame(Player player1, Player player2) {
        this.player1 = player1;
        this.player2 = player2;
        board = new ChessBoard();
    }

    public void play() {
        // game loop
    }
}


```

In this example, the ChessPiece interface defines the move method that should be implemented by all the chess pieces. Each chess piece such as Pawn, Knight, Rook, Bishop, Queen, and King implement the move method with their own logic. The ChessBoard class is responsible for keeping track of the chess pieces on the board and handling the movement of the chess pieces. The Player class represents the players of the game and contains the player's name and color. The ChessGame class represents the game itself and contains the chess board and players. The play method in the ChessGame class is responsible for implementing the game loop.

This is just an example of how the chess game can be implemented in Java. This can be further expanded and optimized. Additionally, You can add more test cases to cover different scenarios and edge cases and also include test cases for other methods in the ChessGame class.


Here is an example of how test cases and sample inputs can be used to test the Chess Game implementation:

```
public class ChessGameTest {
    private ChessGame chessGame;
    private Player player1;
    private Player player2;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        player1 = new Player("Player1", Color.WHITE);
        player2 = new Player("Player2", Color.BLACK);
        chessGame = new ChessGame(player1, player2);
    }

    @Test
    public void testMovePiece() {
        assertTrue(chessGame.board.move(1, 0, 2, 0)); // valid pawn move
        assertFalse(chessGame.board.move(0, 0, 3, 3)); // invalid knight move
    }

    @Test
    public void testCheckMate() {
        // set up board to simulate checkmate
        assertTrue(chessGame.isCheckMate());
    }

    @Test
    public void testStaleMate() {
        // set up board to simulate stalemate
        assertTrue(chessGame.isStaleMate());
    }
}


```


In this example, the setUp method creates a new ChessGame object with two players and sets up the chess board. The testMovePiece test case tests the movement of a chess piece and check if it is a valid move. The testCheckMate test case sets up the chess board to simulate a checkmate situation and tests if the checkmate function is working correctly. The testStaleMate test case sets up the chess board to simulate a stalemate situation and tests if the stalemate function is working correctly.

You can add more test cases to cover different scenarios and edge cases and also include test cases for other methods in the ChessGame class.
