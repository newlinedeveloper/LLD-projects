The Null Object pattern is a design pattern that provides a consistent way of dealing with null values and helps to reduce the number of null checks in your code. In this pattern, a null object is an object with no real implementation, but it provides a default behavior that does nothing.

Here is an example of how the Null Object pattern can be implemented in Java:


```
interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle");
    }
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

class NullShape implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        // Do nothing
    }
}

class Canvas {
    private Shape shape;

    public Canvas(Shape shape) {
        this.shape = shape;
    }

    public void draw() {
        shape.draw();
    }
}


```

In this example, we have an interface Shape with three implementing classes Rectangle, Circle, and NullShape. The Canvas class has a Shape field that can be any of the three implementing classes, and a draw() method that calls the draw() method of the Shape object.

If we want to create a canvas with a null shape, we can create a NullShape object, and pass it to the Canvas constructor:


```
Canvas canvas = new Canvas(new NullShape());
canvas.draw(); // Do nothing


```

This way, we can avoid null pointer exceptions and handle null values in a consistent way.

It's worth mentioning that this is just one possible implementation, and depending on the requirements of your system, the design may vary.

You can also use Optional class in Java 8 and above which provides some useful methods to handle Null values in a more elegant way.
