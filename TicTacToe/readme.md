how you can design a Tic Tac Toe game using Java:

Create a class TicTacToe that will handle the game logic. This class should have a 2D array of characters to represent the game board and methods such as play(), isWon(), and isDraw() to check the game status.

Create a class Player that will represent a player in the game. This class should have properties such as the player's name, symbol (X or O), and a method to make a move.

In the play() method of the TicTacToe class, use a while loop to continue the game until a player wins or the game is a draw. Within the while loop, use the nextMove() method of the Player class to get the player's move and update the game board.

Use the isWon() method to check if a player has won the game by getting the symbol of the current player and checking the rows, columns, and diagonals of the game board for a win.

Use the isDraw() method to check if the game is a draw by checking if all the spaces on the game board are filled and no player has won.

Here is an example of the Tic Tac Toe game low level design implemented in Java:


```
public class TicTacToe {

    private char[][] board;
    private Player player1;
    private Player player2;

    public TicTacToe() {
        board = new char[3][3];
        player1 = new Player("Player 1", 'X');
        player2 = new Player("Player 2", 'O');
    }

    public void play() {
        while (!isWon() && !isDraw()) {
            player1.nextMove(board);
            if (isWon()) {
                System.out.println(player1.getName() + " wins!");
                return;
            }
            if (isDraw()) {
                System.out.println("It's a draw!");
                return;
            }
            player2.nextMove(board);
            if (isWon()) {
                System.out.println(player2.getName() + " wins!");
                return;
            }
            if (isDraw()) {
                System.out.println("It's a draw!");
                return;
            }
        }
    }

    public boolean isWon() {
        // Check rows
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            if (board[i][0] == board[i][1] && board[i][1] == board[i][2]) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        // Check columns
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            if (board[0][i] == board[1][i] && board[1][i] == board[2][i]) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        // Check diagonals
        if (board[0][0] == board[1][1] && board[1][1] == board[2][2]) {
            return true;
        }
        if (board[0][2] == board[1][1] && board[1][1] == board[2][0]) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    public boolean isDraw() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == ' ') {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}

class Player {
    private String name;
    private char symbol;

    public Player(String name, char symbol) {
        this.name = name;
        this.symbol = symbol;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void nextMove(char[][] board) {
        // Prompt the player for their next move
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println(name + ", please enter your next move (row column): ");
        int row = input.nextInt();
        int column = input.nextInt();

        // Make the move
        board[row][column] = symbol;
    }
}


```



In the Player class, it has two properties, name and symbol, it also has a nextMove method which will take the 2D array (game board) as an input, it will prompt the user to enter the next move (row and column) and will update the board with the symbol of the player.

You can run the TicTacToe class to play the game by creating an instance of the class and calling the play() method.

Please be aware that this is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game and it does not handle many edge cases such as invalid inputs, or positions already taken.

here are some sample test cases and inputs for the Tic Tac Toe game:

```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    TicTacToe game = new TicTacToe();
    game.play();
}


```


This is a basic test case which will start the game, it will continuously prompt the players for their next move until the game is won or drawn.

Here are some sample inputs for the players:

Test case 1: Player 1 enters row 1, column 1
Test case 2: Player 2 enters row 2, column 2
Test case 3: Player 1 enters row 0, column 2
These inputs will represent the position on the board where the player wants to place their symbol.
