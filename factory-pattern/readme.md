The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a super class, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. The pattern separates the process of creating objects from the classes that use them.

In Java, this can be achieved by using interfaces and classes to define the factory and the objects that it creates. Here's an example of how to implement the Factory Design Pattern in Java:


```
interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
    }
}

class Square implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Square");
    }
}

class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape getShape(String shapeType) {
        if (shapeType == null) {
            return null;
        }
        if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("CIRCLE")) {
            return new Circle();
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("SQUARE")) {
            return new Square();
        }
        return null;
    }
}


```

In this example, the Shape interface defines the draw method, the Circle and Square classes implement this interface and provide their own implementation of the draw method. The ShapeFactory class is responsible for creating the objects of the Circle and Square classes. The getShape method takes a string as an argument, which is used to determine the type of object that should be created and returned.

The client code can use the factory to create objects without needing to know the specific class that will be instantiated. This allows for a level of abstraction and decoupling between the client code and the classes that it uses. For example, the following code creates and draws a circle and square without knowing their specific class:

```
ShapeFactory shapeFactory = new ShapeFactory();

Shape shape1 = shapeFactory.getShape("CIRCLE");
shape1.draw();

Shape shape2 = shapeFactory.getShape("SQUARE");
shape2.draw();


```

The Factory Design Pattern is a powerful pattern that allows for flexibility and maintainability in the code by creating objects through a common interface, without the client code needing to know about the specific classes that are instantiated. This pattern also allows for easy addition of new classes without modifying the factory or the client code. This pattern is widely used in various areas such as GUI, databases, and other systems that require dynamic object creation.
