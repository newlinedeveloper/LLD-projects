Designing a parking lot system would involve several components, such as a Parking Lot class, a Parking Space class, a Vehicle class, and classes for different types of vehicles (e.g. Car, Motorcycle, etc.).

Here is an example of a possible low-level design for a parking lot system using Java:


```
// Payment class
public class Payment {
    private double amount;
    private LocalDateTime time;
    private PaymentType type;

    public Payment(double amount, PaymentType type) {
        this.amount = amount;
        this.time = LocalDateTime.now();
        this.type = type;
    }

    public double getAmount() {
        return amount;
    }

    public LocalDateTime getTime() {
        return time;
    }

    public PaymentType getType() {
        return type;
    }
}

// PaymentType Enum
public enum PaymentType {
    CASH, CREDIT_CARD, DEBIT_CARD
}

// ParkingLot class
public class ParkingLot {
    private int numSpaces;
    private int numAvailableSpaces;
    private List<ParkingSpace> spaces;
    private Map<Vehicle, Ticket> parkedVehicles;
    private Map<Ticket, Payment> payments;

    public ParkingLot(int numSpaces) {
        this.numSpaces = numSpaces;
        this.numAvailableSpaces = numSpaces;
        this.spaces = new ArrayList<ParkingSpace>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numSpaces; i++) {
            spaces.add(new ParkingSpace(i));
        }
        this.parkedVehicles = new HashMap<Vehicle, Ticket>();
        this.payments = new HashMap<Ticket, Payment>();
    }

    public Ticket parkVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
        for (ParkingSpace space : spaces) {
            if (!space.isOccupied() && vehicle.getSize() <= space.getSize()) {
                space.occupy(vehicle);
                numAvailableSpaces--;
                Ticket ticket = new Ticket(vehicle, space);
                parkedVehicles.put(vehicle, ticket);
                return ticket;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }

    public double removeVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
        Ticket ticket = parkedVehicles.get(vehicle);
        if (ticket != null) {
            Payment payment = payments.get(ticket);
            double amount = 0;
            if (payment != null) {
                amount = payment.getAmount();
            }
            for (ParkingSpace space : spaces) {
                if (space.getOccupyingVehicle() == vehicle) {
                    space.vacate();
                    numAvailableSpaces++;
                    parkedVehicles.remove(vehicle);
                    payments.remove(ticket);
                    break;
                }
            }
            return amount;
        }
        return 0;
    }

    public void makePayment(Ticket ticket, double amount, PaymentType type) {
        Payment payment = new Payment(amount, type);
        payments.put(ticket, payment);
    }

    public int getNumAvailableSpaces() {
        return numAvailableSpaces;
    }
}


// Car class
public class Car extends Vehicle {
    public Car(String licensePlate) {
        super(licensePlate);
        this.size = 1;
    }
}

// Bike class
public class Bike extends Vehicle {
    public Bike(String licensePlate) {
        super(licensePlate);
        this.size = 0.5;
    }
}

// Truck class
public class Truck extends Vehicle {
    public Truck(String licensePlate) {
        super(licensePlate);
        this.size = 2;
    }
}

// Ticket class
public class Ticket {
    private Vehicle vehicle;
    private ParkingSpace parkingSpace;
    private LocalDateTime timeIn;

    public Ticket(Vehicle vehicle, ParkingSpace parkingSpace) {
        this.vehicle = vehicle;
        this.parkingSpace = parkingSpace;
        this.timeIn = LocalDateTime.now();
    }

    public Vehicle getVehicle() {
        return vehicle;
    }

    public ParkingSpace getParkingSpace() {
        return parkingSpace;
    }

    public LocalDateTime getTimeIn() {
        return timeIn;
    }
}



// ParkingSpace class
public class ParkingSpace {
    private int spaceNumber;
    private Vehicle occupyingVehicle;
    private int size;

    public ParkingSpace(int spaceNumber) {
        this.spaceNumber = spaceNumber;
        this.occupyingVehicle = null;
        this.size = 1; // default size
    }

    public boolean isOccupied() {
        return occupyingVehicle != null;
    }

    public void occupy(Vehicle vehicle) {
        this.occupyingVehicle = vehicle;
    }

    public void vacate() {
        this.occupyingVehicle = null;
    }

    public int getSize() {
        return size;
    }

    public Vehicle getOccupyingVehicle() {
        return occupyingVehicle;
    }
}

// Vehicle class
public abstract class Vehicle {
    private String licensePlate;
    private int size;

    public Vehicle(String licensePlate) {
        this.licensePlate = licensePlate;
    }

    public int getSize() {
        return size;
    }
}


```

In this example, the ParkingLot class has an array of ParkingSpace objects, and a method for parking a vehicle which finds the first available parking space and parks the vehicle there. The leave method finds the parking space that the given vehicle is parked in and frees it. The ParkingSpace class has a reference to the vehicle that is occupying it, and methods for checking if the space is occupied and for occupying or leaving the space.

The design can be further enhanced by adding different types of vehicles like Cars, Bikes, Trucks, etc and their respective classes can inherit from the vehicle class and can have their unique properties and methods. The parking lot class can also have different sections for different types of vehicles, with methods for checking availability and parking vehicles in the appropriate section.

Additionally, it would be useful to have methods for checking the number of available spaces, displaying the status of the parking lot, calculating the charges for parking, keeping a record of the parked vehicles, etc.

This is just a basic example of a low-level design for a parking lot system, and it can be further enhanced and optimized based on the specific requirements of the application.

In summary, low-level design of a parking lot system involves creating classes for parking lot, parking space, vehicles and different types of vehicles, and implementing methods for parking and leaving vehicles, checking availability, keeping track of parked vehicles and calculating charges.
