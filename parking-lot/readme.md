Designing a parking lot system would involve several components, such as a Parking Lot class, a Parking Space class, a Vehicle class, and classes for different types of vehicles (e.g. Car, Motorcycle, etc.).

Here is an example of a possible low-level design for a parking lot system using Java:


```
class ParkingLot {
    private int numSpaces;
    private ParkingSpace[] spaces;
    
    public ParkingLot(int numSpaces) {
        this.numSpaces = numSpaces;
        this.spaces = new ParkingSpace[numSpaces];
        for (int i = 0; i < numSpaces; i++) {
            spaces[i] = new ParkingSpace();
        }
    }
    
    public boolean parkVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
        for (int i = 0; i < numSpaces; i++) {
            if (!spaces[i].isOccupied()) {
                spaces[i].occupy(vehicle);
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    public void leave(Vehicle vehicle) {
        for (int i = 0; i < numSpaces; i++) {
            if (spaces[i].getOccupyingVehicle() == vehicle) {
                spaces[i].leave();
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}

class ParkingSpace {
    private Vehicle occupyingVehicle;
    
    public boolean isOccupied() {
        return occupyingVehicle != null;
    }
    
    public void occupy(Vehicle vehicle) {
        this.occupyingVehicle = vehicle;
    }
    
    public void leave() {
        this.occupyingVehicle = null;
    }
    
    public Vehicle getOccupyingVehicle() {
        return occupyingVehicle;
    }
}

class Vehicle {
    private String licensePlate;
    private String make;
    private String model;
    private int size;
    private String color;
    // getters and setters
}


```

In this example, the ParkingLot class has an array of ParkingSpace objects, and a method for parking a vehicle which finds the first available parking space and parks the vehicle there. The leave method finds the parking space that the given vehicle is parked in and frees it. The ParkingSpace class has a reference to the vehicle that is occupying it, and methods for checking if the space is occupied and for occupying or leaving the space.

The design can be further enhanced by adding different types of vehicles like Cars, Bikes, Trucks, etc and their respective classes can inherit from the vehicle class and can have their unique properties and methods. The parking lot class can also have different sections for different types of vehicles, with methods for checking availability and parking vehicles in the appropriate section.

Additionally, it would be useful to have methods for checking the number of available spaces, displaying the status of the parking lot, calculating the charges for parking, keeping a record of the parked vehicles, etc.

This is just a basic example of a low-level design for a parking lot system, and it can be further enhanced and optimized based on the specific requirements of the application.

In summary, low-level design of a parking lot system involves creating classes for parking lot, parking space, vehicles and different types of vehicles, and implementing methods for parking and leaving vehicles, checking availability, keeping track of parked vehicles and calculating charges.
