The Builder Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, so that the same construction process can create different representations.

The pattern consists of:

The "builder" interface, which defines the methods for building the parts of the object.
The "concrete builder" class, which implements the builder interface and provides an actual implementation of the methods.
The "director" class, which uses the builder interface to construct the object.
The "product" class, which represents the complex object being constructed.
Here is an example of how the Builder Design Pattern could be implemented in Java for building a car object:


```
// The "builder" interface
interface CarBuilder {
    void setMake(String make);
    void setModel(String model);
    void setYear(int year);
    void setColor(String color);
    void setTransmission(String transmission);
    Car getCar();
}

// The "concrete builder" class
class HondaBuilder implements CarBuilder {
    private Car car;

    public HondaBuilder() {
        car = new Car();
    }

    @Override
    public void setMake(String make) {
        car.setMake(make);
    }

    @Override
    public void setModel(String model) {
        car.setModel(model);
    }

    @Override
    public void setYear(int year) {
        car.setYear(year);
    }

    @Override
    public void setColor(String color) {
        car.setColor(color);
    }

    @Override
    public void setTransmission(String transmission) {
        car.setTransmission(transmission);
    }

    @Override
    public Car getCar() {
        return car;
    }
}

// The "director" class
class CarDirector {
    private CarBuilder builder;

    public CarDirector(CarBuilder builder) {
        this.builder = builder;
    }

    public void buildMinimalViableCar() {
        builder.setMake("Honda");
        builder.setModel("Civic");
        builder.setYear(2020);
    }

    public void buildFullFeaturedCar() {
        builder.setMake("Honda");
        builder.setModel("Civic");
        builder.setYear(2020);
        builder.setColor("Red");
        builder.setTransmission("Automatic");
    }
}

// The "product" class
class Car {
    private String make;
    private String model;
    private int year;
    private String color;
    private String transmission;

    public void setMake(String make) {
        this.make = make;
    }

    public void setModel(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }

    public void setYear(int year) {
        this.year = year;
    }

    public void setColor(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    public void setTransmission(String transmission) {
        this.transmission = transmission;
    }

    public String getMake() {
        return make;
    }

    public String getModel() {
        return model;
    }

    public int getYear() {
      return year
    }
    
        public String getColor() {
        return color;
    }

    public String getTransmission() {
        return transmission;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Car{" +
                "make='" + make + '\'' +
                ", model='" + model + '\'' +
                ", year=" + year +
                ", color='" + color + '\'' +
                ", transmission='" + transmission + '\'' +
                '}';
    }
}

// Usage of the Builder Design Pattern

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CarBuilder builder = new HondaBuilder();
        CarDirector carDirector = new CarDirector(builder);

        //Build minimal viable car
        carDirector.buildMinimalViableCar();
        Car minimalViableCar = builder.getCar();
        System.out.println("Minimal Viable Car: " + minimalViableCar);

        //Build full featured car
        carDirector.buildFullFeaturedCar();
        Car fullFeaturedCar = builder.getCar();
        System.out.println("Full Featured Car: " + fullFeaturedCar);
    }
}

// Output:
// Minimal Viable Car: Car{make='Honda', model='Civic', year=2020, color='null', transmission='null'}
// Full Featured Car: Car{make='Honda', model='Civic', year=2020, color='Red', transmission='Automatic'}


```
In this example the class Car represent the complex object we want to construct and the CarBuilder interface is the Builder class which defines the methods for building the parts of the object, the HondaBuilder class is the concrete builder class which implements the builder interface and provides an actual implementation of the methods. The CarDirector is the director class which uses the builder interface to construct the object and the Main class is where we use all the classes to construct the car object.

It's important to note that the example above is a simple example of how the Builder Design pattern could be implemented and in real world scenario the implementation may be more complex and may include more classes, interfaces and methods. Also the Builder Design pattern could be used with other design patterns like the Abstract Factory, Prototype, and Singleton to create a more flexible and maintainable system.

Here are some examples of test cases and sample inputs that you could use to test your implementation of the Builder Design Pattern using Java code:

1. Test case: Build a minimal viable car

```
    CarBuilder builder = new HondaBuilder();
    CarDirector carDirector = new CarDirector(builder);
    carDirector.buildMinimalViableCar();
    Car minimalViableCar = builder.getCar();
    assertEquals("Honda", minimalViableCar.getMake());
    assertEquals("Civic", minimalViableCar.getModel());
    assertEquals(2020, minimalViableCar.getYear());
    assertEquals(null, minimalViableCar.getColor());
    assertEquals(null, minimalViableCar.getTransmission());

```

2. Test case: Build a full featured car

```
    CarBuilder builder = new HondaBuilder();
    CarDirector carDirector = new CarDirector(builder);
    carDirector.buildFullFeaturedCar();
    Car fullFeaturedCar = builder.getCar();
    assertEquals("Honda", fullFeaturedCar.getMake());
    assertEquals("Civic", fullFeaturedCar.getModel());
    assertEquals(2020, fullFeaturedCar.getYear());
    assertEquals("Red", fullFeaturedCar.getColor());
    assertEquals("Automatic", fullFeaturedCar.getTransmission());

```

3. Test case: Build a car with custom color and transmission

```
    CarBuilder builder = new HondaBuilder();
    CarDirector carDirector = new CarDirector(builder);
    builder.setColor("Yellow");
    builder.setTransmission("Manual");
    carDirector.buildMinimalViableCar();
    Car customCar = builder.getCar();
    assertEquals("Yellow", customCar.getColor());
    assertEquals("Manual", customCar.getTransmission());

```

These test cases are just examples to show how you can use test cases and sample inputs to test your implementation of the Builder Design Pattern, you can add more test cases to cover more scenarios and edge cases.
