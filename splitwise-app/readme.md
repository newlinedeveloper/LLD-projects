A low-level design for an Expense Sharing App like Splitwise using Java could include the following components:

User: This class represents a user of the app and would contain information such as name, email, and a list of their expenses.

Expense: This class represents an expense and would contain information such as the amount, description, and a list of the users involved in the expense.

Group: This class represents a group of users and would contain information such as the group name, a list of the users in the group, and a list of expenses for the group.

ExpenseService: This class would handle the logic for adding and editing expenses, calculating the amounts owed by each user, and updating the balances for each user.

GroupService: This class would handle the logic for creating and managing groups, including adding and removing users from a group.

UserService: This class would handle the logic for creating and managing users, including adding expenses to a user's account and updating their balance.

Database: This class would handle the connection to the database and provide methods for storing and retrieving data such as users, groups, and expenses.

GUI/UI: This class would handle the user interface and provide methods for displaying the data to the user and accepting user input.

Here is an example of a possible class structure:

```

public class User {
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private List<Expense> expenses;
    private float balance;

    public User(String name, String email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
        expenses = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addExpense(Expense expense) {
        expenses.add(expense);
        balance += expense.getAmount() / expense.getUsers().size();
    }

    public void updateBalance(float amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }

    public List<Expense> getExpenses() {
        return expenses;
    }

    public float getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}


public class Expense {
    private float amount;
    private String description;
    private List<User> users;

    public Expense(float amount, String description, List<User> users) {
        this.amount = amount;
        this.description = description;
        this.users = users;
    }

    public float getAmount() {
        return amount;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }

    public List<User> getUsers() {
        return users;
    }
}

public class Group {
    private String name;
    private List<User> users;
    private List<Expense> expenses;

    public Group(String name, List<User> users) {
        this.name = name;
        this.users = users;
        expenses = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addExpense(Expense expense) {
        expenses.add(expense);
    }

    public void addUser(User user) {
        users.add(user);
    }

    public void removeUser(User user) {
        users.remove(user);
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public List<User> getUsers() {
        return users;
    }

    public List<Expense> getExpenses() {
        return expenses;
    }
}

public class ExpenseService {
    public void addExpense(Expense expense) {
        for (User user : expense.getUsers()) {
            user.addExpense(expense);
        }
    }

    public void editExpense(Expense expense, float newAmount) {
        for (User user : expense.getUsers()) {
            user.updateBalance(newAmount - expense.getAmount());
            expense.setAmount(newAmount);
        }
    }

    public Map<User, Float> calculateBalances(Group group) {
        Map<User, Float> balances = new HashMap<>();
        for (User user : group.getUsers()) {
            float balance = 0;
            for (Expense expense : group.getExpenses()) {
                if (expense.getUsers().contains(user)) {
                    balance += expense.getAmount() / expense.getUsers().size();
                }
            }
            balances.put(user, balance);
        }
        return balances;
    }

    public Map<User, Float> calculateOwes(Group group) {
        Map<User, Float> balances = calculateBalances(group);
        Map<User, Float> owes = new HashMap<>();
        float totalBalance = 0;
        for (Float balance : balances.values()) {
            totalBalance += balance;
        }
        float averageBalance = totalBalance / group.getUsers().size();
        for (Map.Entry<User, Float> entry : balances.entrySet()) {
            owes.put(entry.getKey(), averageBalance - entry.getValue());
        }
        return owes;
    }
}

public class GroupService {
    public void createGroup(String name, List<User> users) {
        Group group = new Group(name, users);
    }

    public void addExpense(Group group, Expense expense) {
        group.addExpense(expense);
        expenseService.addExpense(expense);
    }

    public void addUser(Group group, User user) {
        group.addUser(user);
    }

    public void removeUser(Group group, User user) {
        group.removeUser(user);
    }
}


```


Here are some examples of test cases and sample inputs that you could use to test your Expense Sharing App like Splitwise using Java code:

1. Test case: Create a new group and add users to it

```
    // Create a new group
    GroupService groupService = new GroupService();
    groupService.createGroup("Weekend Trip", Arrays.asList(new User("John"), new User("Sarah"), new User("Mike")));

    // Get the created group
    Group group = groupService.getGroup("Weekend Trip");

    // Assert that the group is created with the correct name and users
    assertEquals("Weekend Trip", group.getName());
    assertEquals(3, group.getUsers().size());
    assertTrue(group.getUsers().contains(new User("John")));
    assertTrue(group.getUsers().contains(new User("Sarah")));
    assertTrue(group.getUsers().contains(new User("Mike")));


```

2 . Test case: Add an expense to a group

```
    // Create a new expense
    Expense expense = new Expense(100, "Hotel stay", Arrays.asList(new User("John"), new User("Sarah")));

    // Add the expense to the group
    groupService.addExpense(group, expense);

    // Assert that the expense is added to the group
    assertEquals(1, group.getExpenses().size());
    assertEquals(expense, group.getExpenses().get(0));


```

3. Test case: Remove a user from a group

```
    // Remove a user from the group
    groupService.removeUser(group, new User("Mike"));

    // Assert that the user is removed from the group
    assertEquals(2, group.getUsers().size());
    assertFalse(group.getUsers().contains(new User("Mike")));


```

4. Test case: Calculate the balance for each user in a group

```
    // Calculate the balance for each user in the group
    ExpenseService expenseService = new ExpenseService();
    Map<User, Float> balances = expenseService.calculateBalances(group);

    // Assert that the balances are calculated correctly
    assertEquals(50f, balances.get(new User("John")), 0.01);
    assertEquals(50f, balances.get(new User("Sarah")), 0.01);


```

5. Test case: Calculate the amount each user owes in a group

```
    // Calculate the amount each user owes in the group
    Map<User, Float> owes = expenseService.calculateOwes(group);

    // Assert that the owes are calculated correctly
    assertEquals(0f, owes.get(new User("John")), 0.01);
    assertEquals(0f, owes.get(new User("Sarah")), 0.01);


```

6. Test case: Edit an expense

```
    // Edit the expense
    expenseService.editExpense(expense, 150);

    // Assert that the expense is edited correctly
    assertEquals(150, expense.getAmount(), 0.01);


```

Splitwise Simplify Debt Algorithm

Splitwise uses a simplified debt algorithm to calculate the amount that each person in a group owes to the others. The algorithm works by first calculating the balance for each person in the group. This is done by dividing the total amount of each expense by the number of people who shared the expense, and then adding or subtracting the resulting amount from each person's balance, depending on whether they were a payer or a spender.

Once the balances are calculated, the algorithm then calculates the amount each person owes to the others by subtracting the average balance from each person's balance. This ensures that the sum of all the debts is zero, as the person who owes the most will be owed by the person who owes the least.

The algorithm can be implemented in java by creating a class that represents the group, and in that class add methods for adding expenses, adding users, and calculating the balances and debts. The methods for calculating balances and debts can use the formulas described above to do the calculations.

The algorithm can be further optimized by using data structures such as HashMap to store the balances, and to improve the performance by avoiding multiple iterations over the data.

It's important to note that this is a simplified algorithm and it may not work well with more complex scenarios, and there may be other ways to implement this algorithm with better performance and accuracy.
