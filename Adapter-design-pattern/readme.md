The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to adapt one interface to another so that classes can work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. Here is an example of a possible low-level design for an adapter pattern in Java:


```
interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle");
    }
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

interface AdvancedShape {
    void draw3D();
}

class Triangle implements AdvancedShape {
    public void draw3D() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a 3D triangle");
    }
}

class TriangleAdapter implements Shape {
    AdvancedShape triangle;

    public TriangleAdapter(AdvancedShape triangle) {
        this.triangle = triangle;
    }

    public void draw() {
        triangle.draw3D();
    }
}



```

In this example, the Shape interface defines the draw method and the Rectangle and Circle classes implement this interface. The AdvancedShape interface defines the draw3D method and the Triangle class implements this interface. The TriangleAdapter class implements the Shape interface and adapts the AdvancedShape interface. The draw method in the TriangleAdapter class calls the draw3D method of the AdvancedShape interface. This allows the Triangle class to be used as a Shape class.

This is just an example of how the Adapter Design Pattern can be implemented in Java. You can use this pattern to adapt other classes and interfaces and this can be further expanded and optimized. Additionally, you can add more test cases to cover different scenarios and edge cases and also include test cases for other methods in the Shape, AdvancedShape and TriangleAdapter classes.


Here is an example of how test cases and sample inputs can be used to test the Adapter Design Pattern implementation in Java:

```
public class AdapterTest {
    private Shape[] shapes = new Shape[3];

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        shapes[0] = new Rectangle();
        shapes[1] = new Circle();
        shapes[2] = new TriangleAdapter(new Triangle());
    }

    @Test
    public void testDraw() {
        for (Shape shape : shapes) {
            shape.draw();
        }
        /*
        Expected output:
        Drawing a rectangle
        Drawing a circle
        Drawing a 3D triangle
         */
    }
}


```

In this example, the setUp method creates an array of Shape objects, which includes a Rectangle, a Circle and a TriangleAdapter. The testDraw test case iterates through the array of Shape objects and calls the draw method on each object. The draw method of TriangleAdapter class calls the draw3D method of the AdvancedShape interface. This allows the Triangle class to be used as a Shape class.

You can add more test cases to cover different scenarios and edge cases and also include test cases for other methods in the Shape, AdvancedShape and TriangleAdapter classes.
