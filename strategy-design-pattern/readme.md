The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior at runtime by selecting a different implementation of an interface. The pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

In Java, this can be achieved by using interfaces to define the strategies and a Context class to hold a reference to the strategy and change it at runtime. Here's an example of how to implement the Strategy Design Pattern in Java:

```
interface Strategy {
    int doOperation(int num1, int num2);
}

class Addition implements Strategy {
    public int doOperation(int num1, int num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }
}

class Subtraction implements Strategy {
    public int doOperation(int num1, int num2) {
        return num1 - num2;
    }
}

class Context {
    private Strategy strategy;

    public Context(Strategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void setStrategy(Strategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public int executeStrategy(int num1, int num2) {
        return strategy.doOperation(num1, num2);
    }
}


```

In this example, the Strategy interface defines the method doOperation that takes two integers as parameters. The Addition and Subtraction classes implement this interface and provide their own implementations of the doOperation method. The Context class holds a reference to the strategy and can change it at runtime. The executeStrategy method is called on the context class, which in turn calls the doOperation method of the strategy.

This pattern allows the code that uses the Context class to change the behavior of the doOperation method by changing the strategy, without modifying the Context class. For example, the following code would add two numbers:


```
Context context = new Context(new Addition());
System.out.println("10 + 5 = " + context.executeStrategy(10, 5));

```

While this code would subtract two numbers:

```
context.setStrategy(new Subtraction());
System.out.println("10 - 5 = " + context.executeStrategy(10, 5));

```

The Strategy Design Pattern is a powerful pattern that allows for flexibility and maintainability in the code by decoupling the algorithms from the classes that use them. It's a great way to add new behavior to a class without modifying it, and also a way to add new algorithms to the codebase without modifying the existing code.
