A low-level design of a Snake and Ladder game in Java would involve several components such as a Game class, a Board class, a Player class, a Dice class, and a Snake and Ladder class.

Here is an example of a possible low-level design for a Snake and Ladder game using Java:

```

// GameBoard class
public class GameBoard {
    private int[] board;
    private int numSquares;
    private int[] snakes;
    private int[] ladders;

    public GameBoard(int numSquares, int[] snakes, int[] ladders) {
        this.numSquares = numSquares;
        this.board = new int[numSquares];
        this.snakes = snakes;
        this.ladders = ladders;
    }

    public int movePlayer(int currentPosition, int roll) {
        int newPosition = currentPosition + roll;
        if (newPosition > numSquares) {
            return currentPosition;
        }
        if (snakes[newPosition] != 0) {
            newPosition = snakes[newPosition];
        } else if (ladders[newPosition] != 0) {
            newPosition = ladders[newPosition];
        }
        return newPosition;
    }
}

// Dice class
import java.util.Random;

public class Dice {
    private Random random;

    public Dice() {
        this.random = new Random();
    }

    public int roll() {
        return random.nextInt(6) + 1;
    }
}

// Player class
public class Player {
    private String name;
    private int position;

    public Player(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.position = 0;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }

    public int getPosition() {
        return this.position;
    }

    public void setPosition(int position) {
        this.position = position;
    }
}

// SnakeAndLadderGame class
public class SnakeAndLadderGame {
    private GameBoard board;
    private Dice dice;
    private Player[] players;

    public SnakeAndLadderGame(int numSquares, int[] snakes, int[] ladders, String[] playerNames) {
        this.board = new GameBoard(numSquares, snakes, ladders);
        this.dice = new Dice();
        this.players = new Player[playerNames.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < playerNames.length; i++) {
            this.players[i] = new Player(playerNames[i]);
        }
    }

    public void play() {
        boolean gameOver = false;
        while (!gameOver) {
            for (int i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
                Player currentPlayer = players[i];
                int roll = dice.roll();
                System.out.println(currentPlayer.getName() + " rolled a " + roll);
                int newPosition = board.movePlayer(currentPlayer.getPosition(), roll);
                currentPlayer.setPosition(newPosition);
                System.out.println(currentPlayer.getName() + " is now on square " + currentPlayer.getPosition());
                if (currentPlayer.getPosition() == board.getNumSquares()) {
                    gameOver = true
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Game Over! The winner is " + currentPlayer.getName());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numSquares = 100;
        int[] snakes = {17, 54, 62, 64, 87, 93, 95, 98};
        int[] ladders = {1, 4, 9, 21, 28, 36, 51, 71};
        String[] playerNames = {"Player 1", "Player 2"};
        SnakeAndLadderGame game = new SnakeAndLadderGame(numSquares, snakes, ladders, playerNames);
        game.play();
    }
}


```


In this example, the main method creates a new SnakeAndLadderGame object and starts the game by calling the play() method. The game board has 100 squares, 8 snakes and 8 ladders, and 2 players. The game continues until one of the players reaches the last square and wins the game.

In this code, I have just hardcoded the values for snakes, ladders, and player names, you can change it as per your requirement. Also, this is a basic implementation of the game and you can add more functionality to it like keeping track of the score, displaying a graphical board, etc.
