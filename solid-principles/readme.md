The SOLID principles are a set of five principles for object-oriented software design, which were introduced by Robert C. Martin. They are intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. The SOLID principles are:

1. Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change.
2. Open/Closed Principle: A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle: Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes.
4. Interface Segregation Principle: A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
